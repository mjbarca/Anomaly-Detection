# Anomaly-Detection
This repository contains the public material generated for the master's thesis related to the detection of anomalies in in-house devices. The code has been generated in python using Google Colab as a development tool. The content is as follows:
Notebooks:
- RoomsView.ipynb --> load data and shows room data
- DataStudy.ipynb --> load data and makes a study of data. Makes as well data preprocessing to generate models. generate scaled data already preprocesed
- LSTM_model.ipynb --> generates LSTM model from preprocesed data
- AnomalyDetection_mono.ipynb --> detects anomalies from data in a monovariable scenario 

Data has been are collect from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranakrc/smart-building-system. This dataset is collected from 255 sensor time series, instrumented in 51 rooms in 4 floors of the Sutardja Dai Hall(SDH) at UC Berkeley.
